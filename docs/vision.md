Our vision is to be the leading OSS personal finance software used by college students to grandmothers. 

Actual Budget is 
* **Local-first**
* **Open**
* **Sleek and clutter-free**
* **Stable**
* **Reliable**
* **Secure**
* **Privacy focused**
* **Community-driven**

### Local-first

Actual is local first, meaning that the database that powers Actual Budget, and ultimately your budget, lives on your device. We don't store it on a server. Now you're wondering, what 'actual server' is for? Well, that allows you to sync changes to your budget on different devices. To do this, only the changes to the budget are sent to the server. The server stores the messages, and the client pulls down the change(s).

### Open 

Actual is Open Source utilizing the MIT license. The code is open for anyone to see, view, and contribute. You own your data; you can do whatever you want with it.

### User Interface

The sleek and clutter-free user interface is simple to use for beginners and comes packed with progressive discoverability for advanced users. The responsive interface adapts to the screen size you are using to give you the best experience for that device. A desktop computer will have the full desktop experience designed to be used with a keyboard and mouse, while a tablet and phone will have an experience ideal for using touchscreens. A separate mobile app, often found in app stores and marketplaces, is not planned.

### Stable, Reliable, Secure.

The contributors to Actual Budget don't just write the program; they USE the program. Â We all have a vested interest in maintaining reliability, security, and stability. If issues are found, bug reports are welcomed so that issues can be remedied immediately.

### Privacy Focused  

Actual has no trackers, and unless explicitly enabled, no third-party access is allowed.

### Community-driven

Actual Budget, being community-driven means that development is driven by the community and the maintainers.

# Third party use
Actual is MIT licensed which allows for the use of the software without restriction.
